this is a simple application in react, that uses NyKredit hackaton HAL api. It aims at dispalying existing and adding new customers.
to run this project:
1) clone repo
2) ``cd react_hal_api``
3) ``npm install``
4) ``npm run scss``
5) ``npm start``


App is very simple, because I want to make it in as little time as possible. It is, nevertheless fully functional. It only lacks any extra/more advanced options.
